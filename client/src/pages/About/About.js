  <p>One third of all food produced is lost or wasted. Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food per year. Here at Waste Not! we are passionate about reducing food waste. By providing everyone a platform to upload food that they don't need. Allowing others to not have to skip a meal. Waste Not! was created by Kylie Gilbert, Luis Debourg and Peter O'Callaghan </p>  </div>
